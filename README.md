https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents

Learn the React way to build rich interactive UIs using both class and function components with React Hooks, and build a game for kids with it.

Building efficient web and mobile interfaces is often challenging and requires the use of imperative logic. React enables you to declaratively describe user interfaces in terms of their state, and it will do the heavy lifting of natively building them for you. In this course, React: Getting Started, you will delve into the fundamental concepts about React and use them to build practical web applications. First, you will see how to design class components and stateful function component, how to one-way flow data and behavior in a component tree, and how to read and update state elements. Then, you will delve into modern JavaScript features used with React like arrow functions, destructuring rest and spread operators, classes, async/await, and more. Next, you will learn some core React tasks like taking input from the user, reading data from an API, managing side effects like timers, and sharing stateful logic with custom hooks. Finally, you will explore how to configure and use a local JavaScript development environment on your machine. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge you need to understand React projects, and start simple React applications from scratch.
